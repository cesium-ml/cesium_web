# vim ft=yaml

# Notes below compliments of the scikit-image team:

# - Use http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/ to make sure the yaml
#   file is valid.  http://lint.travis-ci.org/ is recommended
#   elsewhere but does not give helpful error reports.

# - Make sure all of your "-" lines start on the same column

# - Use bash scripts for `before_install` and `script` or any part
#   that has conditional statements
#    - Make sure they are "executable" (chmod +x)
#    - Use the following header:

#    ```
#      #!/usr/bin/env bash
#      set -ex
#    ```

# - Use the `retry` bash function from `before_install.sh` before a
#   command to have it try 3 times before failing.

# - Use `pip install --retries N` for retrying package downloads.

# - Use the `section` function to start a folded section of the
#   script.  Section names must have underscores or dots instead of
#   spaces and must be accompanied by a corresponding `section_end`
#   call.

# - Feel free to cancel a build rather than waiting for it to go to
#   completion if you have made a change to that branch.

# - A VM with 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 is a huge help for debugging.
